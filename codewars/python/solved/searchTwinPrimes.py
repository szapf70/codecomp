"""
A twin prime is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime numberâ€”for example, either member of the twin prime pair 
(41, 43). In other words, a twin prime is a prime that has a prime gap of two. Sometimes the term twin prime is used for a pair of twin primes; 
an alternative name for this is prime twin or prime pair. (from wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime)

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write a function that counts the number of sets of twin primes from 1 to n.

If n is wrapped by twin primes (n-1 == prime && n+1 == prime) then that should also count even though n+1 is outside the range.

Ex n = 10

Twin Primes are (3,5) (5,7) so your function should return 2!
